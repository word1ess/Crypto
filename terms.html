                        <h2>2.RISK WARNING</h2>
                        <p>
                            2.1 Buying, selling and investing in cryptocurrencies can be risky. The risk of loss in trading or holding cryptocurrency can be substantial. You should therefore carefully consider whether trading or holding cryptocurrency is suitable for you in light of your financial condition. In considering whether to trade or hold cryptocurrency, you should be aware that the price or value of cryptocurrency can change rapidly, decrease, and potentially even fall to zero.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            2.2 The cryptocurrencies market information relating to the past performance of an investment is not necessarily a guide to its performance in the future. The value of investments or income from them may go down as well as up. Like stocks and shares as well, cryptocurrencies are valued from second to second, their bid and offer value fluctuates sometimes widely. The degrees of fluctuation of prices vary significantly and the value of higher volatility funds may change suddenly. The value of investments may rise or fall due to the volatility of world markets, interest rates and capital values or, for investments held in overseas markets, changes in the rate of exchange in the currency in which the investments are denominated. You may not necessarily get back the amount you invested.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            2.3 You know and understand cryptocurrency trading also has certain risks which can cause a complete loss to zero. As cryptocurrencies are no official currency and the legal status is still undefined, their legal nature is subject of change under different jurisdictions. Unlike official currencies, which are backed up by governments or other legal entities like the FED, ECB or others, cryptocurrencies are a private currency, generated by all the world. There is no central bank that could take corrective measures to protect the value of the cryptocurrencies at a possible crisis.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            2.4 You know and understand cryptocurrency trading could be affected by hackers, change of laws, official restrictions, frauds, technical issues, collapse of infrastructure and many other possible threats.
                            <br>
                            <br>

                            2.6 Fortex does not provide any investment advice in connection with the services contemplated by these Terms of Use.

                            2.7 If you are unsure about any specific investment or other decision, you should obtain appropriate expert independent advice and assess carefully whether your financial background is suitable for trading cryptocurrencies. Your decisions and investments are subject to your personal responsibility.
